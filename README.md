This repo was used and then created as a git after it was already done being used and updated. It is mostly a record of code that I used to find gRNA cut site for CRISPR in desert tobacco, Nicotiana obtusifolia. I am looking in four loci, FUL1, FUL2, MBP10, and MBP20. For FUL2 the normal search parameters produced too many off targets, so I also included a search without any mismates (FUL2_noMM).
